#### Abstraction 
For my final project I will be addressing the research question of "Can day trading be a fully automated profession?"
As someone who is interested in day trading, I believe the biggest issue for day traders is time sensitivity. So, this gave me the htought of can we teach computers enough about stocks to have them trade for us?
While that will be a long process I believe the first step is having computers be able to predict stock prices accurately! 
Today, I will be using Amazon stock data up to 2018 from Quandl to predict Amazon stock prices for up to 30 days. 
To do this I will be using multiple techniques including Data Scrapping, Linear Regression and Data Visualization.
