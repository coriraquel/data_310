- How did your model fare?
  - Answer: My model went okay, while the MSE was fairly high (560.195) indicating a large amount of error in the model, when it came to predicting prices at a generally lower price the model did far better than predicting models at a higher price.

- In your estimation is there a particular variable that may improve model performance?
  - Answer: I think looking at neighborhods/zip codes would improve the models performance. Neighborhoods are often sectioned off by prices and have similar sized homes so being able to examine where in the city a house is located would help to improve price predictions.
- Which of the predictions were the most accurate? In which percentile do these most accurate predictions reside? Did your model trend towards over or under predicting home values?
  - Answer: The houses lower in price were the most accurate, the most accurate predictions are around the  25th percentile. My model tended to under predict the values of the home.
- Which feature appears to be the most significant predictor?
    - Answer: Square footage appeared to be the most significant predictor when square footage went up housing prices usually followed as well.
